// init is a special Go function that is automatically executed when the package is loaded.
// It can be used for various initialization tasks such as setting up package-level variables,
// registering drivers, or other setup work that needs to be done before the package is used.
// Currently, this init function is empty but serves as a placeholder for future
// package-specific initialization needs.
func init() {
	// Code initialization (if any) would go here.
	// For example, setting up default configurations or validating package prerequisites.
