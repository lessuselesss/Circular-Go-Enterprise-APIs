// Package utils provides a collection of helper functions and utilities
// supporting the Circular Protocol Go library. This includes functions for making HTTP requests,
// data type conversions (e.g., hex to string), cryptographic operations like hashing and signing,
// and other general-purpose utilities.
package utils

// init is a special Go function that is automatically executed when the `utils` package is loaded.
// It can be used for various initialization tasks such as setting up package-level variables,
// registering drivers, or other setup work that needs to be done before the package is used.
// Currently, this init function is empty but serves as a placeholder for future
// package-specific initialization needs within the utils package.
func init() {
	// Code initialization (if any) for the utils package would go here.
	// For example, setting up default configurations for utility functions
	// or initializing state required by helpers in this package.
}
